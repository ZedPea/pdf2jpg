# PDF to JPG
a VERY in progress PDF to JPG converter, using Python + Flask on the backend, with Javascript/Jquery and a semi Pomf.se style on the frontend.

### Installation
TODO
Should probably figure out how this requirements.txt thing works

### Running
`python pdf2jpg.py` once all the dependencies are installed

If you're deploying this you should use a better server than the default flask one - I used nginx with uWSGI - this has a good tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04
